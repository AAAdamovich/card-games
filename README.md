A Java project for CSC 240 (Java Programming III) that I spent way too 
much time on, leading to the professor of the course to give me an 
'A' on the spot. I did not have to take the final. 

## To Run

The jar package reflects the graded version of the project  
Run with:  

    java -jar PokerHand.jar

## The other README

README.txt (notice the .txt extension) is included as the additional 
README that was included when this project was submitted for grading. 
It mainly contains a series of development and testing notes and 
answers some questions that were required for CSC 240.
